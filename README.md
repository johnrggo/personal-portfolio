## Features

- All of the personal information is populated from the resume.json file following the [JSON Resume](https://jsonresume.org/) standard, a community driven open source initiative to create a JSON based standard for resumes. Discover the official schema [here](https://jsonresume.org/schema/).
- The toggle/switch for the dark mode syncs its state to the local storage.
